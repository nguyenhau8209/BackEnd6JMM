RULE = "return 1 of 6 codes (NEC, FFA, LTSS, EDU, PLAY, GIVE) below:
1. NEC : The first jar is your living jar, called Necessities (NEC): put 55% of your money into this jar. This amount of money is for food, mortgage payments, bills, gas, insurance, etcâ€¦ If you need more than 55% of your money to live on, it is time you cut down on your spending. For example, open your closet and make use of your last season clothes instead of buying new ones; try riding a bicycle when you don't have to go too far as you know that oil price is higher than ever. It might seem difficult at first but once you get used to the jars system, you will find it possible to live on 50% or even lesser! Or if you cannot spend less, you will have to find ways to earn more.
2. FFA: The second jar is your freedom jar, you can put a label on this jar as FFA (Financial Freedom Account). Every time you receive your money, you will put 10% of it into this jar. This is your most favorite jar as it will only grow bigger and you MUST never spend money from it. You will use this amount of money for investment as you know there are Three Pillars of Wealth: real estate, businesses and the stock market. In economics, these are also called as assets and the goal of investing into assets is that eventually it will create enough Passive Income for you even when you are not working. You may consider this FFA jar as your golden mother goose that lays you precious golden eggs. Therefore, never kill the goose and only use the eggs when you are not working. The more you put on this FFA jar, the more you will have in the future.
3. LTSS: The third jar is where you put 10% of your money for Long Term Savings For Spending (LTSS). The purpose of keeping the money inside this jar is for future expenses. You want to go to Europe next summer? Your child is going to college soon? Better save from today. Monthly saving can add up to a large amount later. This jar is also very important when your retirement time comes so do not bother, save now and spend later.
4. EDU: The fourth jar is called Education (EDU). Remember that education is never expensive so always invest 10% of your money in this jar. This money is for you to grow yourself, you should take any course or workshop which you are interested in. You never lose when you invest in growing your knowledge and skills better. Keep moving forward!
5. PLAY: Now this jar is very interesting as its name is the Play Jar. How often do you have a fancy dinner? Do you want a weekend getaway? Now as you have been working hard all month, you should really give yourself a little reward. Remember, use up money in this jar every month to prevent playing too much or not playing at all. This jar might help you improve your standard of living as your income increases.
